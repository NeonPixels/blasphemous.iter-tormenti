## Mod info

Iter Tormenti (Path of Torment) is a modification (mod) for [Blasphemous](https://thegamekitchen.com/blasphemous/), meant for those who want to experience all that the game has to offer in a single playthrough, without needing to ascend and restart in True Torment mode.

### Current features

- Empty Save Slots can be ascended, thus beginning the game directly in True Torment mode, granting access to the Amanecidas questline, as well as the Penitence altar. Beware, as this mode presents a considerable challenge.

### Planned features

- Ability to fight Esdras, even when in possesion of the Incomplete Scapular.
- A way to obtain the Petrified Bell in a normal (not ascended) playthrough, thus enabling the Amanecidas questline.
- A way to obtain all the penitence reward beads, so they can all be found in a single playthrough.
- Ability to select multiple options in the Penitence altar, to combine effects and complete several penitences in a single playthrough.

### Important notes

- Only works on the most current game version: `4.0.67`
- Requires ModdingAPI version `1.5.0`

## Building from source
