## Mod info

### Important notes

- Only works on the most current game version (4.0.67)
- Do not load a vanilla game in the randomizer or vice versa
- Do not load an outdated randomized game in a newer version of the randomizer - seed generation is different

### Questline changes

- Esdras
  - If you have the Scapular, you can choose wether to skip Esdras' boss fight or not. If you fight him, the conversation where he repents will play afterwards.
